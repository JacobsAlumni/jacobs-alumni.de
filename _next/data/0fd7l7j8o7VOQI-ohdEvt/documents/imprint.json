However, like most people in academia, she is fed up with the system and is planning on switching over to industry and pursue a career in Project Management once she's done with her PhD. At Jacobs she was known for being the go to person for event organization, so it seemed like a good way to go. \n\n With (often stupid) jokes on her lips at most times, no capability of telling lies (her tell is that she smiles when she's hiding something and easily gets anxious when questioned, so it's very obvious), and an OCD like need of having a cleared notification board, she will be a reliable correspondent and support. She is always happy talk about and get feedback from the alumni on any and all topics (including food, books, food, comics/manga, food, and if need be - how to improve the Alumni Association and communication)."},{"name":"Zain Dar","role":"member-management","image":true,"meta":{"email":"zdar@jacobs-alumni.de","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/zainsalmandar/"},"description":"Zain ('19) is new."}]},"__N_SSG":true}
