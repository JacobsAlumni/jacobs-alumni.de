                            You can find more information about the items below.
                        </p>

                            The auction will take place as a blind auction where all donations are commitments.
                            A blind auction is an auction where bidders only know their own bid.
                            All donations being commitments means that every bidder will pay their bid - regardless if their bid is highest or not.
