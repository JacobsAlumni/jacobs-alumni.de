                            Every year as part of Homecoming, talented members of the Jacobs University community donate their creativity to raise funds for the Alumni Scholarship Program. As the mission of Jacobs University Alumni Association‚Äôs is the advancement of education, science and research, providing financial support for the next generations of students is key to fulfilling our goal.

                        <p>
                            The Homecoming auction is what is called a 'blind auction'. &quot;What's a blind auction?&quot; you may ask. In a blind auction all bidders simultaneously submit their bids 'blindly' so that no bidder knows the bid of any other participant. While the highest bidder wins the item, all bids are considered donations and go directly to the scholarship program.
