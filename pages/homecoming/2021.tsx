                        <h3>How does the Auction work?</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Homecoming auction is what is called a 'blind auction'. &quot;What's a blind auction?&quot; you may ask. In a blind auction all bidders simultaneously submit their bids 'blindly' so that no bidder knows the bid of any other participant. While the highest bidder wins the item, all bids are considered donations and go directly to the scholarship program. 
                        </p>
