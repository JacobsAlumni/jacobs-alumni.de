In a blind auction all bidders simultaneously submit their bids 'blindly' so that no bidder knows the bid of any other participant. <mark>While the highest bidder wins the item, all bids are considered donations and go directly to the scholarship program.</mark>

The beauty routine being changed from the Victorian frequent use of ammonia or lead-based white paint to the millennial/Gen Z obsession with cosmetic surgeries, injectables and skincare; going to extreme lengths to achieve the Western ideal of beauty.  \nOn the left is shown a colonized woman of colour dealing with the myth of beauty to be the perfect person in the capitalistic world, switching to cosmetic surgeries on the right due to the notion that their face should not have the slightest “flaw”. Trying to fix from the de rigueur injectable facial fillers and botox underlying issues perceived as the physical ones i.e. getting the colour “fixed”, brows fixed, the jaw etc. Capitalism collaborates with patriarchy so as the perceived abnormalities never end, and the woman’s position never improves because the society is never satisfied with her and the fingers still keep pointing to the perceived flaws post surgeries.",
